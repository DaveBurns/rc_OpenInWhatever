        Plugin configuration file (aka 'Advanced Settings').
        
        Note: Named members of return table are accessible in source code as:
        
            app:getPref( name )
            
            provided there is no app:initPref( name, val ) or app:setPref( name, val ) statements executed prior,
            which hide/override the named members in this file.
            
            
        *** Important: when editing, take care to assure punctuation and syntax are not disturbed. In comments, it doesn't matter, but in the rest - every character is meaningful,
                       including spaces, commas, brackets, dots, underscores...
                       
        There are 2 kinds of comments:
        1. single line
        2. multi-line (like this one).
        
        lines beginning with '--' (without the apostrophes) are single line comments.
        lines beginning with '- - [ [' (without the spaces) begin multi-line comments, which end with '- - ] ]' (without the spaces).
        
        Definitions:
        
        * Comment-out: to prepend '--' to a non-comment line making it a comment, or to wrap one or more non-comment lines with '- - [ [' & '- - ] ]'. This turns non-comment lines into comments, rendering them null & void for all practical purposes.
        * Un-comment: to remove the '--' at the front of a comment line thus enabling it to take effect (or removing '- - [ [' & '- - ] ]' wrappage).
        
        
        This configuration file is interpreted in the context of the Elare Plugin Framework - most Lr namespaces are available, and all standard Elare interface objects are available, including:
        
        String/text formatting:
        * str:fmtx - a derivative of Lightroom's LOC function - same syntax for specifying placeholders in the format string..., e.g.
            str:fmtx( "Hello ^1^2", "World", "!!!" ) -- will create the string: "Hello World!!!".
          string.format 'C' string formatting function, e.g.
            string.format( "%u times", count ) -- outputs "5 times", if count is 5.
        Debugging (ignored if advanced debugging is not enabled) :
        * Debug.lognpp - log any number of parameters in a "pretty" format, e.g.
            Debug.lognpp( "before", devSets, "after", photo:getDevelopSettings() ) -- log before and after develop settings.
        * Debug.pause and Debug.pauseIf - shows values of variables, if any, and presents options to keep going or stop, e.g.
            Debug.pause( myvar ) -- stop execution temporarily, and show the value of myvar variable.
            Debug.pause() -- show nothing, but confirm execution has reached this point.
        Logging to plugin log file:
        * app:log and app:logv log file methods, e.g.
            app:log( "Here it is: ^1", it ) -- log it
            app:logv( "hmm..." ) -- log hmm... - included in log file only if verbose logging is enabled.
            
        and MANY more, but the luadoc is out of date - see source code itself for reference.
